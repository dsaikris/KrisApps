st.markdown("""### Observations
- This app loads the rules for each calc run which is extremely slow.
- One machine cannot take so much load so we may need a cluster of machines taking the load evenly.
- Also there is no ledger and due process to handle transactions and taxes.
- We also have the rendering, tax calculation and rule access all mixed up, it needs to be separated. We need
    - UI to place orders
    - Service to manage orders
    - Helper service to calculate taxes
    - Helper services to invoice, process payments, etc.
- From the code you can see we are doing O(n) search in **rules.loc**.
    - With lot of rules this would be extremely slow.
    - We also have **rules.loc(...).values[0]** which is hacky, we should avoid it.
- May be we should organize city level live Seattle.csv and Spokane.csv.
- We can do with category but, I believe typically business will expand region wise than on product wise.
- Pick the column(s) based on access pattern and fan out benefits.
